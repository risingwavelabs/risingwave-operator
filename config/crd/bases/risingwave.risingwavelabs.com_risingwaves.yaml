                                and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows
                                two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows
                                any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this
                                field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate

                    For example, if there's a RisingWaveScaleView targets the current
                    RisingWave, the controller will try to create a new RisingWaveScaleViewLock
                    with the name, uid, target component, generation, and the replicas
                    of targeting groups of the RisingWaveScaleView. After the record
                    is set, the validation webhook will reject any updates on the
                    replicas of any targeting group that doesn't equal the replicas
                    recorded, which makes it a lock similar thing.
