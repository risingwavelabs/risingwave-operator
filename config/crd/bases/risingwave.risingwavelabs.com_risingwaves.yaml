                                objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values
                                (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource
                                feature gate to be enabled.'

                                to a PVC. It may be larger than the actual capacity
                                when a volume expansion operation is requested. For
                                storage quota, the larger value from allocatedResources
                                and PVC.spec.resources is used. If allocatedResources
                                is not set, PVC.spec.resources alone is used for quota

                                is lowered, allocatedResources is only lowered if
