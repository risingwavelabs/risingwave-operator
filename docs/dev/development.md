# Development Guide

This document is a guide to start developing the RisingWave operator.

Please submit an [issue](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave-operator/issues) on Github if you

* Notice a requirement that this doc does not capture
* Find a different doc that specifies requirements (the doc should instead link here)

## Set up the development environment

There are no restrictions in choosing the platform for development. However, we recommend you use a Linux/macOS since they have been verified.

### Hardware Requirements

We recommend the following for any physical or virtual machine being used for developing the RisingWave operator.

* 8GB of RAM
* 40GB of free disk space

The hardware resources are mainly used for the Docker and Kubernetes.

### Installing Required Software

#### Go

If you don't have a Go development environment, please follow the instructions in the [Go Download and Install](https://go.dev/doc/install).

Confirm that your `GOPATH` and `GOBIN` environment variables are correctly set as detailed in [How to Write Go Code](https://go.dev/doc/code) before proceeding.

Currently, building the RisingWave operator requires Go 1.19 or later.

#### Docker

Debugging the RisingWave operator locally requires a Docker environment. To install Docker in your development environment, [follow the instructions from the Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

#### kubectl

You need to install the `kubectl` command-line tool to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. To install it, please follow the instructions in the [Install Tools](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).

The RisingWave operator now requires a 1.16+ Kubernetes cluster, which means you should also keep the requirements valid for `kubectl`.

#### CSpell

We use `CSpell` now to check the spelling of our project. Please follow the instructions in the [Welcome to CSpell](https://cspell.org/).

#### pre-commit

We recommend using the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to identify simple issues before submission to code review. We've already written [a pre-defined config](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave-operator/blob/main/.pre-commit-config.yaml). Please follow the instructions detailed in the [pre-commit website](https://pre-commit.com/) to install the tool and pre-commit hooks.

The pre-commit will run command in [configuration](/.pre-commit-config.yaml) file. Also need to install the corresponding tools like spellcheck, go-vet, go-cyclo, go-imports etc. During installing, make sure install it in correct `GOPATH`, otherwise system cannot find the command. For MacOS, it defaults to `$HOME/go`.

#### psql

RisingWave provides the PostgreSQL protocol wire compatibility. You can connect the RisingWave with `psql` CLI tool. Please follow the instructions described in the [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) to install. Here're some convenient commands to use if you have the same platform and software management tool.

For macOS, homebrew:

```bash
brew install postgresql
```

For Debian family (Ubuntu/Debian) Linux distributions:

```bash
sudo apt install postgresql-client
```

For Red Hat family (Red Hat Enterprise/Rocky/CentOS/Fedora) and SUSE family (SUSE Enterprise/openSUSE) Linux distributions:

```bash
sudo yum install postgresql
```

or

```bash
sudo dnf install postgresql
```

#### Other tools

We have several tools aside from those mentioned above, they would be automatically downloaded by the makefile target. You can also install them manually.

* [controller-gen](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-tools), >= 0.9
* [goimports-reviser](https://github.com/incu6us/goimports-reviser), >= 2.5
* [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint), >= 1.45
* [kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize), >= v0.13
* [setup-envtest](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/tree/master/tools/setup-envtest), latest
* [ctrlkit-gen](https://github.com/arkbriar/ctrlkit/ctrlkit/cmd/ctrlkit-gen), latest

## Building the RisingWave operator

To build a binary of the RisingWave operator, run the following command:

```bash
make build
```

The binary would be generated in the `bin` directory.

To build a Docker/OCI-compatible image of the RisingWave operator, run the following command:

```bash
# Build a image and tag with "ghcr.io/risingwavelabs/risingwave-operator:latest"
make docker-build

# Build a image and tag with "risingwave/risingwave-operator:latest"
REGISTRY=risingwave make docker-build

# Build a image and tag with "ghcr.io/risingwavelabs/risingwave-operator:nightly"
TAG=nightly make docker-build
```

To build cross-platform (linux/amd64,linux/arm64) images , run the following command:

```bash
make docker-cross-build
```

## Debugging the RisingWave operator

The RisingWave operator consists of two main components

* a webhook server serving the mutating and validation webhooks
* a set of controllers control the operation of CRs (RisingWave)

### Provisioning a local Kubernetes cluster

There're many kinds of local Kubernetes, please follow the instructions they provided to provision the Kubernetes locally:

* [Kubernetes in Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/)
* [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) using Docker as its driver
* [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation) using Docker as its driver
* Other kinds of Kubernetes clusters running inside the Docker VM...

We recommend using the Kubernetes embed or the minikube to provision your local Kubernetes cluster.

### Setting up the Webhook

If you use the Docker desktop to run the Kubernetes cluster (those mentioned above), there's a pre-defined manifest and pre-generated certificate. You can simply install the certificates by running the following command:

```bash
make copy-local-certs
```

and now you are ready to start a local operator and debug it.

However, if you use other Kubernetes deployments, e.g., minikube in a VM, you have to prepare the certificates and manifests manually.

**The following content is a little bit advanced. You have to know more details about the webhooks. Read the introduction about the [Dynamic Admission Control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/) before you get started.**

To debug locally, one thing you have to ensure is that the `api-server` of the Kubernetes cluster must have access to your host environment, specifically the webhook server (HTTP server).

#### Generate the certificates

Find the IP or hostname of your host that the `api-server` has access to, say that is:

* IP: 192.18.0.1
* or Hostname: host.minikube.local

Run the following commands to generate a certificate for an IP:

```bash
mkdir -p ${TMPDIR}/k8s-webhook-server/serving-certs
export IP=192.18.0.1
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes \
    -keyout ${TMPDIR}/k8s-webhook-server/serving-certs/tls.key \
    -out ${TMPDIR}/k8s-webhook-server/serving-certs/tls.crt -subj "/CN=localhost" \
    -extensions san -config <(echo '[req]'; echo 'distinguished_name=req'; echo '[san]'; echo "subjectAltName=IP:${IP}")
```

Run the following commands to generate a certificate for a hostname:

```bash
mkdir -p ${TMPDIR}/k8s-webhook-server/serving-certs
export HOST=host.minikube.local
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes \
    -keyout ${TMPDIR}/k8s-webhook-server/serving-certs/tls.key \
    -out ${TMPDIR}/k8s-webhook-server/serving-certs/tls.crt -subj "/CN=localhost" \
    -extensions san -config <(echo '[req]'; echo 'distinguished_name=req'; echo '[san]'; echo "subjectAltName=DNS:${HOST}")
```

#### Install the webhook configurations

Modify the [config/local/webhook.yaml](/config/local/webhook.yaml) to match your IP/hostname and certificates:

1. Replace the `webhooks.*.clientConfig.caBundle` with the base64 encoded CA certs, which can be obtained by running the following command:

```bash
base64 ${TMPDIR}/k8s-webhook-server/serving-certs/tls.crt
```

2. Replace the `host.docker.internal` in `webhooks.*.clientConfig.url` with your host IP or hostname used above, like this:

```yaml
webhooks:
- clientConfig:
    url: "https://192.168.0.1:9443/validate-risingwave-risingwavelabs-com-v1alpha1-risingwave"
```

Now you're all set! Let's start debugging the RisingWave operator!

### Start debugging

Before getting started, please run the following commands to perform some checks and try running the operator locally:

#### Check the Kubernetes cluster

```bash
kubectl version --short
```

Expect output:

```bash
Client Version: v1.24.2
Kustomize Version: v4.5.4
Server Version: v1.24.0
```

#### Install the local manifests

The local manifests contain the CRD and the webhook configurations, run the following command to install them:

```bash
make install-local
```

Check the CRDs and webhook configurations with the following commands:

```bash
kubectl get crd
```

Expected output:

```bash
NAME                                          CREATED AT
risingwaves.risingwave.risingwavelabs.com   2022-06-21T06:17:20Z
```

```bash
kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration,validatingwebhookconfiguration
```

Expected output:

```bash
NAME                                                                                                           WEBHOOKS   AGE
mutatingwebhookconfiguration.admissionregistration.k8s.io/risingwave-operator-mutating-webhook-configuration   1          19h

NAME                                                                                                               WEBHOOKS   AGE
validatingwebhookconfiguration.admissionregistration.k8s.io/risingwave-operator-validating-webhook-configuration   1          19h
```

#### Run the operator locally

You can find an example of the expected output in this [PR](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave-operator/pull/87).

```bash
make run-local
```

Now stop the process and we're ready for debugging.

#### Start debugging in VSCode

Debugging in VSCode requires a launch configuration, you can use the following configuration:

```jsonc launch.json
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "RisingWave Operator",
            "type": "go",
            "request": "launch",
            "mode": "auto",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/cmd/manager/manager.go",
            "args": [
                "-zap-time-encoding", "rfc3339",
            ],
            "env": {
                "NO_PROXY": "kubernetes.docker.internal,127.0.0.1,localhost"
            },
        }
    ]
}
```

Now start debugging by clicking the menu **[Run > Start Debugging]** or pressing **F5**. The following is a list of significant functions/methods/files that might be useful as breakpoints:

* `main() cmd/manager/manager.go`, the entry point of the RisingWave operator
* `RisingWaveController.Reconcile() pkg/controller/risingwave_controller.go`, the core function of the RisingWave operator
* `pkg/webhook/risingwave_mutating_webhook.go`, the entry point of the mutating admission webhook for RisingWave
* `pkg/webhook/risingwave_validating_webhook.go`, the callbacks of the validating admission webhook for RisingWave

#### Start debugging in other IDEs

Follow the instructions of [GoLand Debugging](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/debugging-code.html) to launch a debugging process like in VSCode.

# Deploy your custom operator into your local cluster

Sometimes it may be necessary to observe your changes to the operator in the context of your local cluster. You can do so by following these steps: 

```bash 
make docker-build # creates a local image with your changes
kubectl delete deployment risingwave-operator-controller-manager -n risingwave-operator-system # delete the old operator 
```

Go into `config/risingwave-operator-test.yaml`. 
Change the `image` to your local image (e.g. `ghcr.io/risingwavelabs/risingwave-operator:latest`).
Change the `imagePullPolicy` to `Always`. 
Apply your local operator via. 

```bash 
kubectl apply --server-side=true -f config/risingwave-operator-test.yaml 
```

Be advised: It may be necessary to load your local images into your cluster if you are using `kind`. 
You can do so by using the command `kind load docker-image`
